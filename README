About:

        A simple port scanner written in C++ by Keith Craigie (https://kcraigie.com)
        Uses poll() for single-threaded concurrency.

Usage:

        kcportscan -4 [ipv4_address</prefix>] -t <timeout_ms> -s <services_file>

Parameters:

        ipv4_address (required): The IPv4 address you want to portscan.  Use /prefix to specify an address block.

        timeout_ms: Timeout for connections in milliseconds.  Defaults to 3000ms.

        services_file: Path to a file that maps service names to ports.  Defaults to /etc/services.

Notes:

        To get more concurrent connection attempts, use "ulimit -n <bigger_number>" before running kcportscan.
